## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

The app is a way for developers to find clients and vice versa.
The app is also a way for developers to find other developers and for clients to find other clients. 
Additionally, we call these "Teams". This is where people can collaborate and find work for each other.

Users have 2 different points. 
|                | Community    | Skill      |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Description    | How "trustworthy" the user is | How "skillfull" the user is  |
| Applicable to  | Developers & Clients | Just developers |
| Calculated by  | How much they contribute to the site | How much work they add to the site |
| Imporance      | Both are equally important | |

Welcome to the client-dev-app root app.
